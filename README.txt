This module grabs the attention of a site visitor in some splashy way

This is far more than an annoying banner advertisement, rather it allows a site
developer to remind visitors to sign-up for email updates or other administrative
tasks that are impending.  It gives the visitor the option to close (permantently
) or minimize (remind on next page refresh) the reminder so as to keep the
disruption to a minimum.

------------

1. This module requires several other modules, including jquery_update and
   jquery_ui.  Installing these two modules will update jQuery to 1.3 and
   allow you to install jQuery UI 1.7.  Review jquery_ui README for 1.7
   installation instructions.

2. Copy the attention module / directory to your sites/SITENAME/modules 
   directory or sites/all/modules directory.

3. Enable the module at Administer >> Site building >> Modules.
